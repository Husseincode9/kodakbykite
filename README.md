# kodakbykite  

A personal photography site built with **Next.js**.  

## 📸 Inspiration  
I always take a **disposable Kodak camera** with me on holiday, capturing little snapshots of my trips. Over time, I collected so many photos that I wanted a dedicated place to share them. That’s how **kodakbykite** was born.  

## 🛠️ Tech  
- Built with the **Next.js framework**  
- Deployed on **Vercel**  
- More features and content coming soon 🚀  

## 🌍 Live Site
